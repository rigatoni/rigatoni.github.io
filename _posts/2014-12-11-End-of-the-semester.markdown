Well, it's been a busy couple of weeks since this blog was updated. On Tuesday, we finally completed our interim presentation. We've also been going catching up on all of our documentation and ensuring that everything is up to date, especially the requirements document and the architecture document. We only have a few final tasks left to close out this semester.

We're also looking forward to the spring semester. In addition to a small amount of work that we'll be doing over intersession, we have six iterations planned for the semester, leaving us a little time at the end for Al Dente work, documentation updates, and presentation prep. The first iteration has already been planned out with issues assigned, so we should be ready to hit the ground running in January!
