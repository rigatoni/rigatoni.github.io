We've officially started our first iteration of the spring. Things are still going well in terms of development, though we've had some issues with the VM behind the scenes. We decided to migrate our environment to our SG VM, which is our long-term hosting strategy anyways. We're also going to take the time to set up a real production environment, since in the past we've just had a dev environment. 

There's a number of new features that we're implementing for this iteration, so we're hoping to really start ramping up the fuctionality present in the system. We have a lot of groundwork that's been laid in place, which puts us in a strong position moving forward. We're also exploring some new areas this iteration. Specifically, we're looking to bring Stanford CoreNLP into the system, and we're also starting to implement topic modeling. These are some exciting new pieces of the system which should a lot of valuable functionality.
