title:      A Mostly Successful Iteration
date:       2014-11-05
summary:    Much progress has been made, but some issues were encountered too.

Overall, our second iteration was successful. 7 out of 8 intended issues were completed, or 87.5%. Linguine is still up at rigatoni.se.rit.edu, and now includes the ability to upload files. Uploaded files are available only to the user who uploaded them. Python also now integrates fully with MongoDB, loading documents and storing results into the database. We also did some restructuring of the Python code to make it a little easier to work with. We also have some visualization code completed, but it hasn't been fully integrated into the rest of our code base just yet.

Despite all of this progress, there's still quite a bit of work to be done. There's some structural elements of the application that still aren't in place that probably should have been on our radar a little sooner. The most prominent item that still needs to be completed is giving Node the ability to communicate to the Python app so we can actually start running analyses. This will be important for completing user testing at the end of the month, and delivering an end-to-end user experience. 

For Iteration 3, we're shelving any new analyses to focus on completing that user experience. Since we only have one more iteration to go before our user testing begins, it's important that we acheive that milestone in the third iteration.
