summary:	Our first iteration is complete!
---
After two weeks, we've finished our first iteration! On the Node side, we've set up RIT LDAP authentication, so users can sign in with their RIT accounts. On the Python side, we've implemented the call/response format. We also implemented the operators for tf-idf and removing capitalization and puncutation. While it may not look like much yet, we're very happy that we were able to implement all of our planned features for Iteration 1.

For Iteration 2, we'll be putting the main structure of the user interface in to place, adding support for uploading files, and adding some basic visualization to the Node side. On the Python side, we'll be adding integration to MongoDB and implementing some new analyses. All of us felt like we could have been busier during Iteration 1, so we're going to be a little more ambitious for the next iteration.
