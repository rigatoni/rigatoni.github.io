summary:	We successfully demoed our first iteration, and are moving on to the second.

Despite some last-minute hijinks with our virtual machine (which need not be elaborated on), we had a successful demo of the functionality we implemented for the first iteration. It's up at rigatoni.se.rit.edu. While it may not look like much yet, we're very happy with the groundwork we laid, and that there weren't any major roadbloacks or issues with our development process. 

Since all of us felt that we could've been a bit more ambitious during the first iteration, we're going to try developing a little more aggresively for this next iteration. We still have our user testing deadline looming in late November, so we're trying to have as much functionality as possible by then. 

We're also going to be revisiting one of our metrics after discussing it with our faculty coach and project sponsor. The "Issues Closed" metric isn't particularly meaningful, since there's no baseline or goal number for it. One possible replacement is "Percentage of Issues Closed", which would represent the accuracy of our estimations. 

Our other metrics all looked good for the first iteration. Hours Spent clocked in a little low, but we already were planning on a more ambitious Iteration 2, so we're not overly concerned. Our unit test coverage metric sits at 80%. We'd like it to be closer to the 90% mark, so we'll be focusing on unit testing going forward.
